#YAML intro

# Comments in YAML start with the # character
# Key value pairs are separated by a colon
key: values
"key with quotes": "value with quotes"
323: 3342

# Special characters can include !@#$%^&*()_+{}[]|;':",.<>?
special_characters: "value with special characters !@#$%^&*()_+"
single_quotes: "value with single quotes '"
double_quotes: "value with double quotes \""
other_unicode: "value with unicode characters ðŸ˜Š or \u263B"

# Lists or arrays (sequences) are represented by a dash followed by a space
list:
  - item1
  - item2
  - item3

array:
  - 1
  - 2
  - 3

# JSON arrays can be represented as a list of objects
json array: [hello, world]

numbers: 100
boolean: true
null: null
also null: ~

# objects (maps) are represented by key value pairs
object (maps):
  key: value
  key2: value2
  nested object:
    nested key: nested value

json style object: {
    "key": "value",
    "key2": "value2",
    "nested object": {
      "nested key": "nested value"
    }
  }

# Nested objects can be represented by indenting the key value pairs
sequebce:
  - item1
  - item2 
  - key: value
  - key2: value2
  - 0.5
  - nested object:
      - nested key: nested value
      - - another nested key: another nested value
      - - - yet another nested key: yet another nested value
      - - - - even more nested key: even more nested value

# Literal block scalar style
literal blow: |
  This is a literal block scalar style
  It preserves newlines and leading spaces
  without interpreting escape sequences

# Folded block scalar style
folded block: >
  This is a folded block scalar style

  It preserves newlines but removes leading spaces
  and interprets escape sequences

# To remove new line characters, use a backslash followed by a -
literal block without new lines at the end: |-
  This is a literal block scalar style
  with new lines
  asdf
 
folded block without new lines at the end: >-
  This is a folded block scalar style

  It preserves newlines but removes leading spaces
  and interprets escape sequences

# To preserve all new lines, use a backslash followed by a +
literal block with new lines at the end: |+
  This is a literal block scalar style
  with new lines
  asdf


folded block with new lines at the end: >+
  This is a folded block scalar style

  It preserves newlines but removes leading spaces


  and interprets escape sequences
